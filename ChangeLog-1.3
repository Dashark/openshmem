Updates in Release 1.3:
========================

Configure
---------

    * Run configure with "--help" to see all options/flags.

Code
----

    * Improved atomics

    * Reworked progress thread setup
        * Requires GASNet 1.18.0 upward for locality routine

Specification
-------------

    * Specification 1.3 adds the "restrict" keyword to the C API, so C
      compilers need to understand C99 to handle OpenSHMEM 1.3 source
      code

    * Constants in the C/C++ API now have *no* leading underscore,
      must be macros, and they match the Fortran names.
